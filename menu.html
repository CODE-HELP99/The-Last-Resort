                    <h3>Chicken Scarpariello</h3>
                    <p>Traditional scarpariello — chicken sautéed in a tangy lemon glaze with bell pepper — <br>is typically made with a whole chicken cut into pieces, then cooked on the stove for hours. To speed things up, we opt for faster-cooking boneless thighs and skip the bell pepper in favor of jarred Peppadews, a sweet-spicy pickled pepper.</p>

                        <h3>Agnolotti Del Plin </h3>
                        <p>These tiny, meat-filled Piedmontese agnolotti (the name translates as "agnolotti with the pinch") originated as a means of using up braised meat. In this version from Casa di Langa's Fàula Ristorante, the agnolotti are stuffed with a pork, chicken, veal, and vegetable filling bound with butter and cheese. </p>

                        <h3>Braised Chicken all'Arrabbiata</h3>
                        <p>All'Arrabbiata means "in an angry style" in Italian. At Marzano in Oakland, California, chef Robert Holt braises his chicken with five kinds of peppers in a wood-fired oven. Here, spice the chicken with poblano and chile flakes, then braise it. For extra kick, toss in some hot pickled cherry peppers.</p>

                        <p>An antipasto dish, bruschetta has grilled bread topped with veggies, rubbed garlic and tomato mix. A country bread sliced and topped with different toppings - the evergreen tomato-basil and an inventive mushroom-garlic. The classic Italian starter!</p>

                        <h3>Lasagna</h3>
                        <p>The ultimate Italian dish has to be this recipe of Lasagna. A secret to the best lasagna recipe lies in the perfectly made, home made bolognese sauce and this bacon and lamb lasagna boasts of a delicious one! Loaded with parmesan cheese and layered with a mix of vegetables, bacon strips and minced lamb.</p>

                        <h3>Tiramisu</h3>
                        <p>The delightful tiramisu recipe with sponge fingers soaked in coffee, layered around and smeared with a creamy mascarpone mixture. The word 'tiramisu' in Italian means 'pick-me-up'. Owing to its caffeine kick it sure does!<br>It is a soft, melt in the mouth dessert that you can pair with tea or right after the dinner.</p>
